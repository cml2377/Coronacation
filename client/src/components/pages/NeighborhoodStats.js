import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class NeighborhoodStats extends Component {

        return (
            <div>
                Statistics; this is just for fun but I would like to show which zipcodes are most needy/most giving.

                This will pull from database-- number of Needs, and number of Needs completed.
            </div>
        )
    }
